# 🏠 Smart Home Network Simulation using Cisco Packet Tracer

## 📘 Project Overview
This project demonstrates a ** smart home network** simulation built using **Cisco Packet Tracer**. The setup integrates various **IoT devices** such as a **fan, light, garage door, window, and door**, all wirelessly connected to a **central IoT server** through a **wireless router (WRT300N)**. The configuration includes both wired and wireless networking to monitor and control devices in real-time.

## 🛠️ Key Features
- Wireless connectivity of IoT devices to the network.
- IoT Server configuration for device control and monitoring.
- Desktop client configured to manage and view IoT statuses.
- Use of **2960-24TT switch** to interconnect server and client devices.
- Real-time simulation of home automation components:
  - Ceiling Fan
  - Light
  - Garage Door
  - Main Door
  - Window

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies
- Cisco Packet Tracer
- IoT Devices (Ceiling Fan, Light, Garage Door, Window, Door)
- Wireless Router (WRT300N)
- 2960 Switch
- IoT Server
- Laptop Client

## 🖥️ Network Architecture
- All IoT devices are connected to the wireless router.
- Router is connected to a Layer 2 switch (2960-24TT).
- The IoT server and monitoring client (laptop) are connected via the switch.
- IoT devices are managed via the **IoT Monitor** application on the client laptop.

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Open the `.pkt` file in Cisco Packet Tracer.
2. Start the simulation by pressing the **Realtime** mode.
3. Use the **IoT Monitor** in the Client Laptop to control or monitor the smart devices.
4. Extend the project by adding automation scripts or more IoT components.

## 📌 Future Enhancements
- Add motion sensors and alarms.
- Integrate with mobile application mockup.
- Configure alerts for unauthorized access.
- Add RADIUS server authentication for network security.
